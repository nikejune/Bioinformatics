# Global And Local Alignment

## Global Alignment

![screenshot1](screenshot1.png)

There are 3 different cases of reaching (i,j) from (i-1, j-1), (i,j-1),or (i-1,j)![screenshot2](screenshot2.png)

Scores(d, s(xi, yj)) refer to the score.txt file

![screenshot2](screenshot3.png)

Create a score matrix and a matrix that shows where it came from

With DP refering scores, record it in order.



## Local Alignment

### Not Affine

![screenshot3](screenshot4.png)

Comparing global alignment, values smaller than 0 are zero because you don't know where to start.![screenshot5](screenshot5.png)

So this is how it works

### Affine Gap Scores

![screenshot6](screenshot6.png)

They don't look different, but the left figure is inserted twice and other is inserted once. So, the left one should have relatively large penalty.![screenshot7](screenshot7.png)



![screenshot8](screenshot8.png)

Comparing global alignment, it needs new design because the direction that comes has become more diverse. And the starting open penalty value must be greater than the extension penalty.



## Global Alignment Implementation

```
# global alignment
# matrix initialization
matrix = []
for i in range(len(seq1_str)) :
    tmp = []
    for j in range(len(seq2_str)) :
        tmp.append(0)
    matrix.append(tmp)

for i in range(len(seq1_str)):
    matrix[i][0] = i * gap

for j in range(len(seq2_str)):
    matrix[0][j] = j * gap

#backtrack initialization
backtrack = []
for i in range(len(seq1_str)) :
    tmp = []
    for j in range(len(seq2_str)) :
        tmp.append("N")
    backtrack.append(tmp)
```

![screenshot9](screenshot9.png)

when gap penalty is 3, This is how it is initialized.



```
# LCS backtrack
for i in range(1, len(seq1_str)) :
    for j in range(1, len(seq2_str)) :
        if seq1_str[i] == seq2_str[j] :
            target = match
        else :
            target = mismatch

        matrix[i][j] = max([matrix[i-1][j] + gap , matrix[i][j-1] + gap, matrix[i-1][j-1] + target])
        if matrix[i][j] == matrix[i - 1][j] + gap:
            backtrack[i][j] = "down"
        elif matrix[i][j] == matrix[i][j - 1] + gap:
            backtrack[i][j] = "right"
        elif matrix[i][j] == matrix[i - 1][j - 1] + target:
            backtrack[i][j] = "diagonal"
```

![screenshot10](screenshot10.png)



## Local Alignment Implementation

```
# LCS Backtrack
for i in range(1, len(seq1_str)) :
    for j in range(1, len(seq2_str)) :
        if seq1_str[i] == seq2_str[j]:
            target = match
        else:
            target = mismatch

        matrix[i][j] = max([0, matrix[i - 1][j] + gap, matrix[i][j - 1] + gap, matrix[i - 1][j - 1] + target])
        if matrix[i][j] == matrix[i - 1][j] + gap:
            backtrack[i][j] = "down"
        elif matrix[i][j] == matrix[i][j - 1] + gap:
            backtrack[i][j] = "right"
        elif matrix[i][j] == matrix[i - 1][j - 1] + target:
            backtrack[i][j] = "diagonal"
```

The difference is the addition of zero to max list.

## Affine Gap Scores Implementation

```
# LCS Backtrack (diagonal)
for idx_i in range(1, len(seq1_str) + len(seq2_str)) :
    for idx_j in range(len(seq2_str)-1) :
        i = idx_i - idx_j
        j = idx_j + 1
        if i < 1:
            break
        if i >= len(seq1_str) :
            continue

        if seq1_str[i] == seq2_str[j]:
            target = match
        else:
            target = mismatch

        matrix[i][j][0] = max([matrix[i - 1][j][0] - extension_penalty, matrix[i - 1][j][1] - open_penalty])
        matrix[i][j][2] = max([matrix[i][j - 1][2] - extension_penalty, matrix[i][j - 1][1] - open_penalty])

        matrix[i][j][1] = max([matrix[i][j][0], matrix[i][j][2], matrix[i - 1][j - 1][1] + target])
        if matrix[i][j][1] == matrix[i][j][0]:
            backtrack[i][j] = "down"
        elif matrix[i][j][1] == matrix[i][j][2]:
            backtrack[i][j] = "right"
        elif matrix[i][j][1] == matrix[i - 1][j - 1][1] + target:
            backtrack[i][j] = "diagonal"
```

Previously, the procession was filled with values in order from the first line. But this time it's filled diagonally.

(ex. (1,1) -> (2,1) , (1,2) -> (3,1) , (2,2) ,(1,3) -> â€¦. )

The score matrix was also increased to three to represent lower, midle, and upper.



## Execution

![screenshot11](screenshot11.png)

There are two sequences that seq1.txt and seq2.txt compare each other, and the score can be found through score.txt.

```
$ python3 alignment.py
```

Let's execute the file. (python 3.6)

```
>seq1  AACTGAGTCA
>seq2  ACCCCCTGAGAGTTCT
============GLOBAL ALIGNMENT===========
AAC---TGAG--T-CA
ACCCCCTGAGAGTTCT
matches : 8
mismatches : 2
gaps : 6
scores : 4
======LOCAL ALIGNMENT(not affine)======
AACTGAG--T-CA
ACCTGAGAGTTCT
matches : 8
mismatches : 2
gaps : 3
scores : 11
```

It prints out what global alignment and local alignment look like, up to the point.

```
*****************Enter the penalties***************
(extension penalty is less than the open penalty)
example : open_penalty : 3, extension_penalty : 1

open_penalty : 3
extension_penalty : 1
========LOCAL ALIGNMENT(affine)========
AACTGAG---TCA
A-CTGAGAGTTCT
matches : 8
mismatches : 1
gaps : 4
scores : 13
```

Furthermore, the local alignment with affine gap scores needs user input to open and extension penalties. You can know the result after you enter it.
